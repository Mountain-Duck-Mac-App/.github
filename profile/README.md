## ‚òÅÔ∏è Overview  

Mountain Duck for macOS allows you to mount cloud storage and remote servers as local drives directly in Finder. By connecting to services like S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, WebDAV, or FTP/SFTP servers, you can access files as if they were stored on your Mac, without constantly downloading and uploading.  

The application combines simplicity with power. Files are streamed on demand, meaning you can work with large datasets without taking up local storage. Its native macOS integration provides a seamless experience with drag-and-drop, copy/paste, and Spotlight search support.  

Ideal for professionals, teams, and developers, Mountain Duck makes remote storage as accessible as local disks. With strong encryption, secure authentication, and fast file transfers, it delivers reliability and performance across all Mac devices, including Apple Silicon models.
